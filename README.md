Project 4 - Capstone Project - "MoodTune: Visualizing and Predicting Moods Based on Music Listening Behavior"

Spotify API Usage & Compliance

This project uses the Spotify Web API solely for the purpose of visualizing publicly available metadata related to music listening behavior (e.g., track titles, artists, audio feature scores such as valence and energy).

We strictly adhere to Spotifyâ€™s Developer Terms of Service and do not:

Use Spotify content or metadata to train, fine-tune, or evaluate any machine learning or AI models.

Ingest Spotify audio features or user-specific data into machine learning pipelines.

Store or redistribute any Spotify content outside of permitted API use.

All machine learning components of this project (e.g., mood prediction models) are trained exclusively on publicly available, properly licensed datasets (e.g., the DEAM dataset) and/or self-reported mood data, independent of Spotify content.
