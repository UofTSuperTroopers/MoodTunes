Compliance Statement for Spotify API Usage in ML Project
Spotify API Compliance Statement

Our project strictly adheres to the Spotify Developer Terms and Policy, including the explicit restriction against using Spotify Content or data to train machine learning or artificial intelligence models.

Specifically:

All machine learning models used in this project are trained exclusively on publicly licensed or external music datasets and do not incorporate Spotify data for training or fine-tuning.

Spotify data accessed through the API is used only in real-time during runtime for model inference (prediction), visualization, and user interaction purposes.

We do not cache, store, bulk download, or redistribute Spotify data beyond what is necessary for immediate runtime processing.

User authentication is performed via OAuth with explicit consent, and all personal data is handled with strict privacy considerations.

This approach ensures full compliance with Spotify’s Developer Policy, protecting Spotify’s content and respecting user privacy.
